sudo wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-repo.gpg.key
sudo apt-key add mosquitto-repo.gpg.key
cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
sudo wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-wheezy.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mosquitto

sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients python-mosquitto

sudo /etc/init.d/mosquitto stop

Open the file as follows:
sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
You should see the following:
# Place your local configuration in /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/
#
# A full description of the configuration file is at
# /usr/share/doc/mosquitto/examples/mosquitto.conf.example

pid_file /var/run/mosquitto.pid

persistence true
persistence_location /var/lib/mosquitto/

log_dest file /var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log

include_dir /etc/mosquitto/conf.d

Change the “log_dest” line to:

log_dest topic
This puts the logging information as a “topic” so we can subscribe to it later on to see what is going on in our IOTRFID system.
Next add the next six lines:
log_type error
log_type warning
log_type notice
log_type information

connection_messages true
log_timestamp true
Now your /etc/mosquitto.conf files should look like:
# Place your local configuration in /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/
#
# A full description of the configuration file is at
# /usr/share/doc/mosquitto/examples/mosquitto.conf.example

pid_file /var/run/mosquitto.pid

persistence true
persistence_location /var/lib/mosquitto/

log_dest topic


log_type error
log_type warning
log_type notice
log_type information

connection_messages true
log_timestamp true

Starting the Mosquitto Server
Now start the mosquitto server:
sudo /etc/init.d/mosquitto start

Testing the Mosquitto server

Open up two more terminal windows.
In Terminal window 1 type:
mosquitto_sub -d -t hello/world
In Terminal window 2 type:
mosquitto_pub -d -t hello/world -m "Hello from Terminal window 2!"
When you have done the second statement you should see this in the Terminal 1 window.
~ $ sudo mosquitto_sub -d -t hello/world
Client mosqsub/3014-LightSwarm sending CONNECT
Client mosqsub/3014-LightSwarm received CONNACK
Client mosqsub/3014-LightSwarm sending SUBSCRIBE (Mid: 1, Topic: hello/world, QoS: 0)
Client mosqsub/3014-LightSwarm received SUBACK
Subscribed (mid: 1): 0
Client mosqsub/3014-LightSwarm received PUBLISH (d0, q0, r0, m0, 'hello/world', ... (32 bytes))
Greetings from Terminal window 2
